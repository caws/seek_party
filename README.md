# SearchParty - Searches made easy

### What is this?

Have you ever had to write a search functionality for a web application and found yourself
having to write SQL code? This is for you. 

SearchParty adds the method #search to classes that extend it and builds and runs those ugly SQL
queries in a nice way by inspecting your attributes and checking what is present in your params hash.

Since it returns an instance of ActiveRecord_Relation, you can chain other scopes/methods if you
so desire.   

Currently compatible with Sqlite3 and PostgreSQL.

### When should I use this?

When coming up with simple search features for a given application. 

### What is this capable of doing?

Below is what's currently doable:
  - search for specific attributes (by passing a params hash where the key is your attribute name and 
    the value is what you're looking for).
  - hit the database with a query containing LIKE for all attributes not present in the BLACK_LIST and using
    a value stored in your params[:search] key. 
  - hit the database with a query containing LIKE and the operator = for all attributes not present in the BLACK_LIST and using
    a value stored in your params[:search] key and a key for one of your attributes (params[:name]).     

PS: The DEFAULT_BLACK_LIST contains the attributes :id, :created_at and :updated_at. You can pass your own
    DEFAULT_BLACK_LIST when calling the #search method from your model.

## Installation

### Instalation

Add the following to your Gemfile

``` ruby
gem 'search_party', '~> 0.0.1'
```
Then run:

``` shell
bundle install
```

Add the SearchParty functionality to your model:

``` ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  extend SearchParty
  ...
end
```

## Usage

Given a User model like the following:

``` ruby
  create_table :users, force: true do |t|
    t.string :name
    t.string :email
  end
```

You could search the table like so:

``` ruby
params = {search: 'bilbo'}
User.search(params: params)
```

And it would produce the following query for Sqlite3:

``` sql
SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE (LOWER(CAST(name AS TEXT)) LIKE '%bilbo%' OR LOWER(CAST(email AS TEXT)) LIKE '%bilbo%')
```

As you can see, it took all of the attributes into consideration when generating the
query. But you can also limit what's going to be used to build such query by writing it 
in the following way:

``` ruby
params = {search: 'bilbo'}
User.search(params: params, white_list: ['name'])
```

Which would in turn produce the following query:

``` sql
SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE (LOWER(CAST(name AS TEXT)) LIKE '%bilbo%')
```

If your params hash does not contain a search key, SearchParty will try to compare
the attributes in your model with the keys available in the params hash.

Which means that the following:

``` ruby
params = {name: 'bilbo'}
User.search(params: params)
```

Would produce a query like this:
``` sql
SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE (LOWER(CAST(name AS TEXT)) = 'bilbo')
```

SearchParty would use the equals operator instead of the LIKE, since it infers that
if you are passing keys that match the attributes in your model, you basically 
know what you are looking for.

But say that you are searching for a record for which you know one
of the attributes for SURE, but not the other(s). In this case, you could use both the search
key as well as one key for each one of your attributes like this:


``` ruby
params = {search: 'bilbo@theshire.com', name: 'bilbo'}
User.search(params: params)
```

And this would result in the following query being produced:

``` sql
SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE (LOWER(CAST(name AS TEXT)) LIKE '%sugoi%' AND LOWER(CAST(name AS TEXT)) = 'bilbo' OR LOWER(CAST(email AS TEXT)) LIKE '%sugoi%' AND LOWER(CAST(name AS TEXT)) = 'bilbo')
```

### TO DO

- Write more tests
- Improve code quality 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
